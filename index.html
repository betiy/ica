<header>The story so far</header>    
<div id='storySoFarText'>
A world of the here and now, a world whose history is long lost to the unstable moods of the mortal whim, that is the world where our heroes are born and raised. Though the Elven empire took great strides to record all that happened since its conception, as reliable as the accounts of one people can be, all that came before is a blur of half-torn records and faded engravings from ages long past.
<p>The current day is one without earth-shattering events, a time of exploration and discovery, but though there is no need for heroes, there is a need for folks brave enough to venture into the forgotten nooks and crannies of this world, to unveil the secrets of the past and solve the puzzle of antiquity. There is a need for adventurers. </p>
<p>Our protagonists are of the Vanguardians, an adventurer&apos;s guild like countless others. At least it would be, had it not been created by a strange hooded man named simply “the Shepherd”. This man, whose face is entirely unknown and whose title is apparently an inside joke, gathered our heroes together without discernable reason or cause, promising naught but a journey and mentioning riches in passing.</p>
<p>As their first assignment, the guild members were sent to investigate the regular disappearances of the citizens of Aevenreath. Once a month, they would get up and leave, gone for three whole days. The townsfolk were enthralled by a lich as it turned out, serving as its energy source in a quest to “surpass the one closest to the gods.” Alas, instead of reaching the might of the gods, the lich was slain in a single spell. </p>
<p>In the Aeingland capital, a strange threat arose. The high church of Pelor was broken into, the altar destroyed to reveal an entrance into the catacombs below. Our investigators discovered that it is the work of demons. The fiends were looking for a book. More specifically, they were looking for a journal belonging to the grandfather of modern magic, August Aureius. Unfortunately, the party retreated before meeting the perpetrators. </p>
<p>Sent on a simple job to retrieve a watch for a noble, who lost it fair and square, the party discovers a convoluted web of secrets and magic in the mage guild of Grayhold. They first determined Meness, son of the missing hero Hadrien of the Void, as their watch thief. After a long goose chase involving the consumption of ancient dragon blood by the boy and a temple of unknown origin being flooded with black ooze, they realized they were wrong. In exchange for the watch, the apprentices of the guild sent them on an even more frustrating set of adventures, until finally revealing that its location is in a magical prison room housing the once most-dangerous witch, Durula. They discovered her reverted to a child-like state, haunted by a red doll and very willing to help out. By the end they decided to not give the watch to the noble and thus returned a fake. Damon got extremely wealthy from selling fake watches after this.</p>
<p>Word reached the guild that a gang of bandits used the chaos in the church of Pelor to steal the shard of the sun that was housed there. The thieves settled down in a tomb beneath Ravenstead, a town with a graveyard three times its size. A system of rooms simply known as the Tomb of the Unnamed God. We do not know what they wished to do there, as the Vanguardians thwarted their plans with some poison, a cat, and a hole they dug in the riverside.</p>
<p>In a very low paying job, the party was employed to catch a child thief. The child, one of many deemed children of disaster and cast away, lives in a cave near the capital with others like her. The cave turned home for the children also contains the ruins of the temple of the Mother Dragon, which, despite the warning signs riddling the place, the gang decides to explore. After discovering the towering, still moving corpse of a primeval dragon and a very close call with death, they elected to just go home.</p>
<p>Hearing a rumor that an infamous noble has imprisoned a succubus in his estate, our heroes decide that they want in on that and set off to free the succubus. They undertook the lengthy journey, picked up an adult man in a child&apos;s body named Arim, and hatched a plan to infiltrate Feifer&apos;s dinner party with Arim&apos;s help. There, they witnessed the old boy&apos;s dark magic and almost got caught, but with some outside help, they did smuggle the succubus out.</p>
<p>While on a routine pickup, Damon overheard that a village was overrun by goblins. He enlisted the help of his fellow guildmates and with the help of a squadron from the capital they bust into town to discover that the goblins were being mind-controlled by a golem in the village&apos;s monument. The golem was trying to send out a message. The Vulture God seeks <q>the mind.</q></p>
<p>Millshear&apos;s guardian worm has been murdered? The Vanguardians proceed to investigate this bizarre claim, only to find that it&apos;s all truth. The mining village is connected directly to a cave system called the Veins, whose ecosystem is filled with odd creatures unlike those on the surface. Everyone decided to never mention what took place there.</p>
<p>A return to Grayhold was eminent and said return occured during the Mage Guild Games, a grand event where the apprentices of all four mage guilds across the continent compete in a week-long series of competitions. While our heroes were away, the situation in Grayhold had become rather more complicated. Ghostly apparitions, demons skulking in the shadows, a dark beast occupying the mess hall, usually par for the course, but not all at the same time. The party joined the staff to investigate, yet many of the mysteries remain yet unresolved. The event reached its peak when Meness, in a failed attempt to disprove the identity of the dragon whose blood now runs in his veins, summoned the selfsame corpse from the Temple of the Mother Dragon. Turns out that the first god of magic, the tyrannical dragon Malruchion, is more than mere fiction. The boy decided to cut ties with Grayhold for now and left for the great northern mountains.</p>
<p>After neglecting his quest for a while, the Vanguardians assisted Tullius in looking for his lost head. To achieve that, they had to stop existing to ender the Dreamlands, a realm born from the dreams of colossal beasts known as the world beasts, as that was the safest way to get to the Nowhere at the time. The head was held by the king of the Netherworld, who tore it off to prevent Tullius from summoning him ever again, and they convinced him to part with it by letting him keep the tongue. </p>
<p>As a light change of pace, our heroes helped a Grayhold apprentice retrieve a journal from a haunted fortress just outside the capital. The fortress had recently become infested with catkin and kenku, who were fighting over the territory that whole time. A pretty simple quest aside from the aforementioned haunt.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a certain duo of Vanguardians, namely Flynn and Soleyna, remained in the capital to finish up a small-time job. They helped a trainee guardsman to find where the beast he was secretly raising ran off to. They explored more of the catacombs, discovered some of August Aureius&apos; journals along with the dragon, and Flynn gained some insight into the Shepherd&apos;s identity.</p>
<p>On their way back from the fortress, our heroes encountered an angel. She had destroyed a relic she was supposed to deliver to the Lord Overseer of Eden. They agreed to help and turned to the merchant of time for assistance. He sent them to the Tomb of the Unnamed God to retrieve a simple decoration in exchange for him fixing the artifact, and so they ventured in. The Unnamed God has connections with Eden it seems.</p>
<p>The Vanguardians are now in the merchant city of Zeltfelden. The city has been afflicted with a terrible curse, one that turns the citizens into mindless cannibals at night. Once more encountering Arim on the road, they&apos;re set to investigate and end this dreadful occurrence.</p>

		"bodytext": "A life of witnessing the sun nourish the plants and livestock, which nourish him and all of mankind, convinced the farmer's son Damon Ghirian that the white, hot circle in the sky is the all-father and all-mother of all life on earth. He took to worshipping his celestial god at an early age, believing that the sun could speak to him and had a will for all her children which he was instructed to show the world. His parents put him in a monastery hoping to cultivate his fanatic spirituality into a more orthodox faith. Damon was taught the language, ways, and traditions of the church, but would never stray from his fundamental convictions which caused great frustration in his peers. Upon reaching adulthood, Damon was sent on a one-man crusade by his abbot who hoped to rid his distracting presence from the monastery. With nothing but his faith and a small allowance for rudimentary equipment, Damon hoped to make a name for himself in the world through feats of heroism which would shape the world to the sun's will and grant him the eyes of the public to which he would preach divine truth.<br>Damon believes that just like the body requires the four humors of blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile to be in balance, the soul consists of four essences which also need to be kept in balance. The essence of will which is cultivated by acting on the world around you, the essence of mind which is cultivated by introspection, the essence of love which is cultivated by spiritual nourishment, and the essence of hate which is cultivated by struggle. Acts of nourishment to the world, like charity, balance the essences of will and love, personal nourishment like prayer and meditation balance mind and love, struggle against the world, like combating heresy and enforcing divine law, balance will and hate while personal struggle, like repentance and confession of one's personal sins, balance mind and hate. Damon's creed is that balanced soul essences are what the sun wishes for all her children and that he is on a mission from god to reveal this truth to all while balancing his own essences and acting as a force of divine will. Damon has a deep disdain for the arcane and distrusts all practitioners of magic until they prove to be of good character as they receive power from a force independent from the sun."

Her mother was and, in many aspects, still is a bit of a rebellious spirit. In her younger years she often snuck away for months from their mansion at the edge of a lavapool. On one such occasion she met Hank Flint a human merchant of tea and tea accessories known for his <q>badass blend<q>. Eleanor is the only child of the union and was treated with spite by the rest of the family which was forced to accept the child.<br>Growing up, Eleanor proved to be unreasonably fire proof even for fire elf standards. She took to swimming in the family's lavapool and playing in the mansion's lit fireplace. This, coupled with her enormous capacity for any and all fire magic earned her the respect and friendship of the fire elemental Logi. Besides the Ignan language Logi also taught her that fire magic was not just about burning things to ash and that most spells can just as well be accomplished with only the essence of fire. Freeing herself from the harsh family tutors, Eleanor set out on a journey to further heighten her talents and becoming a true savant of fire (and fashion). She has an unexplainable obsession with hats."

You have become an expert in the art of slowly excising the leftover arcane energies, preventing most leftover damage to the mind, keeping both your sanity and blood vessels intact – not all of the damage, mind you, as evidenced by how fast ridiculous costumes and personality disorders usually come into play. And you have mastered casting those very spells and imposing your will upon the world – except that no-one really masters those, do they now? You may think yourself different or better than those fools who've slipped up, but sooner or later it'll happen to you, too. A little polymorph gone wrong and backfiring on you, a little light spell instead poisoning the water main, and a fireball thrown at a respectable citizen of no ill intent, well...</br>Now imagine instead for a moment being the poor bugger who got hit by that very same fireball. Not the prettiest of sights usually, but let's say it goes a bit differently this time. The wizard fumbling his impromptu execution and the spell – instead of going off and incinerating you in a split second – gets stuck in your head. Yes, just like a wizard would hold it. Yes, with none of the very important training that prevents the usually rather deadly side-effects. Yes, discovering a rather inconvenient and frankly audacious bounty with your name on it for the heinous theft of a precious spell that allegedly, I quote, held a lot of sentimental. Yes, skipping country right away, changing your name in the process. Yes, surviving the ordeal, but having your head end up far too receptive to things it shouldn’t hold as a side effect. And migraines, let’s not forget those.</br>That's me! I'm that poor bugger. And no, before you ask, that spell is long gone by now, so don’t even bother. Hypothetically speaking, that is.

Since its inception house Albstein went to great lengths to preserve the purity and unique physical traits of its bloodline. In spite of those efforts, a gradual decline has been observed in recent generations, its most obvious manifestation being the loss of magic aptitude. Nobles in the know call it a curse, as even arranged marriages with longstanding mage families prove to be ineffective at reversing this trend.<br>From a young age Galene was tutored at a high level as well as being molded by the family values of noblesse oblige and High Elven-centric speciesism and social Darwinism. Spurred on by her parents' pressure as well as her own diligence she blossomed into a talented and bright young woman. When she started attending military academy, she chose to focus her studies on military history and tactics, but she found that the text books barely covered the tactics of the other nations. Despite carrying within her a strong ingrained prejudice against all non-elves, she still deemed it necessary to learn more about their martial prowess in order to become a worthy officer. While planning to do a grand tour through all major nations of the continent she determined Aeingland to be the perfect starting point because it's considered unassailable by military means and it's known as a melting pot for a myriad of different cultures. Galene's own ability and the values she was raised on gave birth to a highly supercilious and haughty persona which when combined with her limited free time resulted in her having no true friends. Despite that she enjoys helping and guiding others as she believes that to be her duty as a noble. This desire is also linked to her being considered less than a teenager in Elven society due to her young age.<br>Despite trying her best to be imposing and dignified her lack of emotional maturity quickly becomes apparent."

A truly unpredictable person.<br>A druid down to her bones, she came from a strict family of catfolk druids from the eastern regions. She's a talented druid since birth, however she did not bother to hone her talents at all for frivolous reasons, angering her parents which led to them not caring at all when she decided to roam the world when she turned 16. Perhaps it was all according to her plan all along?<br>While she is officially still a novice druid, her capabilities when put to test in the wilderness are quite decent. She actually has an eye for details, but she rarely shows it. Someone once confronted her about it and her excuse was that it's simply more fun to 'not know' rather than to 'know', however she always makes sure to notice any life-threatening details during adventures. Despite her looks and irresponsible attitude, she's fluent in several languages like Elven and Feline. Her striking appearance and bright hair color often draws attention, however, but when she gets to spend some time in the forest, she blends in and become one with nature.
